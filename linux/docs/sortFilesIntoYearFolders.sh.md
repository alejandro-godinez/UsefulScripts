# [sortFilesIntoYearFolders.sh](../sortFilesIntoYearFolders.sh)

This script will list all the files in the current working
directory and move the file into a sub-folder of the year
equal to the last modified date.  

NOTE: modified date/time is used becuase the birth value isn't implemented on
      older EXT file systems and cannot be relied.

TODO:  
1. Improve to use birth value if available and fall back to modified  
2. Add optional argument to allow user to specify file name filter to target  

Version: 2022.3.8
